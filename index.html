            Hello! My name is Dayniz Velasco and I'm from Oaxaca, Mexico, but I live in Nuevo Casas Grandes, Chihuahua, Mexico. I'm 36 years old. I love reading and  learn new things. I have two daughters and I love spent time with them. I currently work as a remote Fullstack Developer in my country. I'm excited to be in this course, because I know that I will learn new concepts that will help me improve my performance in my current job.
